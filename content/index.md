ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Namoe. I'm an AI researcher at <img src="https://favicon.im/ke.com" alt="ke.com favicon"/> Ke.com, passionate about powerful generative AI, efficient model inference, and intelligent compression. This blog is where I share my explorations and thoughts.

I received my M.Phil and Bachelor's degrees from BUAA. During my master's, I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Shan Zhang. I also spent a wonderful time as a research intern at <img src="https://favicon.im/www.sensetime.com" alt="sensetime favicon"/> Sensetime, working alongside Dailan He.
